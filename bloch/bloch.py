    """
    Bloch simulation of rotations due to B1, gradient and
    off-resonance, including relaxation effects.  At each time
    point, the rotation matrix and decay matrix are calculated.
    Simulation can simulate the steady-state if the sequence
    is applied repeatedly, or the magnetization starting at m0.

    INPUT:
            b1 = (1xM) RF pulse in G.  Can be complex.
            gr = ((1,2,or 3)xM) 1,2 or 3-dimensional gradient in G/cm.
            tp = (1xM) time duration of each b1 and gr point, in seconds,
                            or 1x1 time step if constant for all points
                            or monotonically INCREASING endtime of each
                            interval..
            t1 = T1 relaxation time in seconds.
            t2 = T2 relaxation time in seconds.
            df = (1xN) Array of off-resonance frequencies (Hz)
            dp = ((1,2,or 3)xP) Array of spatial positions (cm).
                    Width should match width of gr.
            mode= Bitmask mode:
                    Bit 0:  0-Simulate from start or M0, 1-Steady State
                    Bit 1:  1-Record m at time points.  0-just end time.

    (optional)
            mx,my,mz (NxP) arrays of starting magnetization, where N
                    is the number of frequencies and P is the number
                    of spatial positions.

    OUTPUT:
            mx,my,mz = NxP arrays of the resulting magnetization
                            components at each position and frequency.
